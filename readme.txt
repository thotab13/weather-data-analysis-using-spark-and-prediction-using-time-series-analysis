A motivating challenge in human civilization is weather forecasting. There is a movement in the direction of this issue in scientific research. The complicated phenomena known as weather includes the dynamic interplay of many factors. Numerous numerical weather models and algorithms have been created and put into use to forecast the weather. In many different disciplines, including agriculture, government planning, industry, stock analysis, etc., weather forecasting is extremely important. Every day, a variety of sensors are placed in various geographic places to gather meteorological data. The most difficult task is to efficiently store and evaluate the enormous amount of data. Distributed computing is utilised to solve these problems and challenges utilising big data technology. In order to analyse the meteorological data, Hadoop MapReduce is employed. The in-memory computation performed by spark, a cutting-edge technique, is more effective than Hadoop map-reduce. The greatest average precipitation, temperature, or any other weather-related characteristics for several weather stations are shown in this paper, which suggests the spark implementation for weather data analysis. Also used time series analysis for forecasting the weather.

The Time Series Analysis was performed for dataset . The analysis was performed for the forecast of temperature. The dataset contains hourly data. It was resampled for monthly forecasts and the mean of the respective month was used for the resampled data. The time time series analysis was perfomed using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages(ARIMA). The predictions and forecasts were performed for monthly samples. The steps are :
(i)	Plotting the data as a time series plot,
(ii)	Checking the data, if it has any trend or seasonality
(iii)	Predicting values of ARIMA(p,d,q)
(iv)	Applying ARIMA (P, D ,Q)  to predict future values.
(v)	Forcasting.
